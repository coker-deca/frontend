Frontend Task for Product Factory


This is my first frontend project using mainly css and html. The aim is to learn the syntax faster through use. Obviously the best tools weren't used to get the work done, but this project will eventually be refactored to give the best presentation, adaptation, responsiveness as well as ease of read.

I would also appreciate any contribution in terms of pull request for refactoring the code.

Thanks.
For the love of coding.
